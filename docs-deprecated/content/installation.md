# Installation

Get started with Zap using npm or directly from a CDN for quick prototyping.

## Install via npm

Install Zap using npm or your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @mode-7/zap

# Using yarn
yarn add @mode-7/zap

# Using pnpm
pnpm add @mode-7/zap
```

## CDN Usage

You can also use Zap directly from a CDN without installation:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { Game, Scene, Sprite } from 'https://esm.sh/@mode-7/zap';

  // Your code here...
</script>
```

## Requirements

- Modern browser with ES6+ support
- HTML5 Canvas support
- No external dependencies required

Zap is designed to be lightweight and framework-agnostic. It works great with vanilla JavaScript, React, Vue, or any other framework.
